# phishing-email-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a phishing email highlighting key indicators such as spoofed sender, suspicious links, and social engineering tactics.
Email Threat Detection
1. Spoofed Email Address

The domain mybusiness[.]com is not associated with Google. Real Google emails usually come from @google.com or @accounts.google.com.

2. Urgent Language / Fear Tactic

Phrases like “Sign-in attempt was blocked” and “you should check what happened” are meant to create panic and push the user to act quickly.

 3. Suspicious Button (Call to Action)

The red "Check activity" button is likely linked to a malicious phishing site. Phishing emails commonly use such buttons to capture login credentials.

4.  Generic Recipient Information

The message uses a generic name john.doe and does not mention the actual recipient’s name, which is a red flag for phishing.

5.  Social Engineering Techniques

This email tries to scare the user into clicking a link and providing personal information. The attacker relies on psychological manipulation.
